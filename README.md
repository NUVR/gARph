# gARph
Graphs but they're garphs.

We're making an [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/tutorials/object-manipulation-sample) app that shows graphs and makes 3D shapes and stuff.

## Getting Started

This project is made for [Unity 2018 3.2f](https://unity.com/), so you can install this version with [Unity Hub](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal). The primary scene is `Graph Drag N' Drop`, located in the [Assets/Education/Scenes](Assets/Education/Scenes) folder.
